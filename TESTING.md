# Testing Guidelines

This document outlines the testing practices and guidelines for the Ephemyral project.

## Test Structure

- All test files should be located in the `__tests__` directory.
- Test files should be named with the `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extension.
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks.
- Use meaningful test descriptions that explain the expected behavior.

## Writing Tests

### React Components

- Use `@testing-library/react` for rendering and interacting with components.
- Focus on testing component behavior rather than implementation details.
- Use `screen` queries to find elements in the rendered output.

Example:

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

test('renders MyComponent with correct text', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Utility Functions

- Write unit tests for utility functions to ensure they work as expected.
- Test edge cases and error conditions.

Example:

```typescript
import { myUtilityFunction } from './utilities';

describe('myUtilityFunction', () => {
  test('returns expected result for valid input', () => {
    expect(myUtilityFunction('valid input')).toBe('expected result');
  });

  test('throws error for invalid input', () => {
    expect(() => myUtilityFunction('')).toThrow('Invalid input');
  });
});
```

## Mocking

- Use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate the code being tested.
- Mock external dependencies and API calls.

Example:

```typescript
jest.mock('@/lib/api', () => ({
  fetchData: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: 'mocked data' }),
}));
```

## Test Coverage

- Aim for a minimum of 80% test coverage for critical parts of the application.
- Use `npm run test:coverage` to generate a coverage report.
- Regularly review and improve test coverage.

## Best Practices

1. Keep tests simple and focused on a single behavior.
2. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.
3. Avoid testing implementation details; focus on component behavior and outputs.
4. Use setup and teardown functions (`beforeEach`, `afterEach`) to reduce duplication.
5. Regularly run the test suite to catch regressions early.
6. Update tests when modifying existing functionality.
7. Write tests before implementing new features (Test-Driven Development).

## Continuous Integration

- All tests are automatically run on pull requests and merges to the main branch.
- The CI pipeline will fail if tests do not pass or if coverage thresholds are not met.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a robust and reliable codebase that is easy to refactor and extend.
